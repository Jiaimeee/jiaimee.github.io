<h3>Personal Notes:</h3>
<pre><font size=5>
I learned a lot of new tricks lately.<br> I can't think of anything else to add to the profile, so I'll leave it like that for now.<br> The website looks soo much better, don't you agree?<br> Anyway, I'll be updating this section of the website now and then to share some of my personal thoughts for the week.<br> Tons of tests coming up, and I've been studying really hard.<br> I need to keep up with the others if I want to stay at the top.
